# Beautiful Jekyll

**Beautiful Jekyll** is a ready-to-use template to help you create an awesome website quickly. Perfect for personal blogs or simple project websites.  [Check out a demo](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll) of what you'll get after just two minutes or look at the author's [personal website](http://deanattali.com) to see it in use. You can also see examples of websites other people created using this theme [here](#featured-users).

This template is built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and can be used for any [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website.  If you don't know what Jekyll and GitHub Pages are, you can still use these instructions to build a site quickly, but it might make a little more sense if you read up on them just a little bit.

Feel free to modify this in any way you'd like, but the origional author would appreciate it if you don't remove the attribution to Beautiful Jekyll.
