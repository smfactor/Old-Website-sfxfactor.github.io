I currently work with Adam Kraus applying interferometric analysis techniques to archival data to detect close in companions, binary stars or exoplanets. I am a first year graduate student so this research is preliminary and will likely be my 2nd year project.

My Master's research, at Wesleyan University with Professor A. Meredith Hughes, looked at the initial conditions of planet formation inside disks of gas and dust around young stars. Specifically, I analyzed radio interferometric observations of gas line emission from a protoplanetary disk in the Orion Nebula Cluster. I used a simple model of the gas emission to fit the density and temperature structure of the disk. Using this information, we can compare this disk to the theoretical disk which our own solar system formed from and investigate the likelihood of planet formation. We can also compare this disk, located in a high mass star forming region (SFR), to previously studied disks, in low mass SFR's, to investigate the effect of the surrounding environment. I wrote my Masterâ€™s thesis on this work and it is currently in preparation for submission to a journal.

As an undergraduate, I worked with Professor Fred Ellis on modeling novel optical systems using simple electronics. I focused specifically on systems exhibiting parity time (PT) symmetry. PT-symmetric systems are not symmetric under parity $$ (x \rightarrow -x) $$ or time $$ (t \rightarrow -t) $$ reflection individually but are symmetric under a combined parity and time reflection. A simple example of this is a coupled oscillator system with balanced gain and loss. Under time reversal gain turns into loss and visa versa. Thus a combined parity and time reflection returns the system to its original state. We demonstrated a wide variety of interesting applications of these systems including asymmetric transport and unidirectional lasing. For more information on this work see my three second author papers on my [publications](/publications) page.
