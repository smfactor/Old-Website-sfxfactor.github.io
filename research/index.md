My Master's research, with Professor A. Meredith Hughes, looked at the initial conditions of planet formation inside disks of gas and dust around young stars. Specifically, I analyzed radio interferometric observations of gas line emission from a protoplanetary disk in the Orion Nebula Cluster. 

As an undergraduate, I worked with Professor Fred Ellis on modeling novel optical systems using simple electronics.
